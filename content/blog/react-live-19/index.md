- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) can be used _inside_ a SVG to animate parts of that SVG.
- React state containers: [Mobx State Tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree)
- React state containers: [Overmind](https://overmindjs.org).
- Using Cypress for performance testing and let your build fail when a page is slower than xxx seconds: https://github.com/yoavniran/reactlive2019.
- Lazy loading big chunks of data, for example in a table: https://react-window.now.sh/.
